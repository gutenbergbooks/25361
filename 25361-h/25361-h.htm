<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p><i>Hooray!</i> Oh, you <i>must</i> let me holloa. I'm one of the famed "Surrey Crowd,"</p>
<p>And a roar for a win such as <i>this</i> is, can<i>not</i> be too long or too loud.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/061-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/061-1.png" alt="" /></a><h3>Lo! man!</h3></div>
<p>Won by four wickets! As good as though <span class="sc">Walter</span> had scored half a million,</p>
<p>Great Scott! what a rush from the ring! what a crowd round the crowded Pavilion!</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lohmann! Maurice Read!! Shuter</span>!!! they shouted. <span class="sc">Key!!! Key!!! Lohmann!!! Lohmann</span>!!!</p>
<p>"Took down the number" of Notts, Sir, and <i>she's</i> a redoubtable foeman.</p>
<p><i>We</i> haven't licked her for years, and she crowed, Sir, and not without reason;</p>
<p>And now, under <span class="sc">Shuter</span>, we've done it at last, Sir, and twice in one season!</p>
<p>After a terrible tussle; how oft was my heart in my mouth, Sir.</p>
<p>Luck now seemed to lean to the North, and anon would incline to the South, Sir.</p>
<p>Game wasn't won till 'twas lost. Hooray, though, for Surrey! 'Twas <i>her</i> win.</p>
<p>We missed our <span class="sc">Wood</span> at the wicket, Notts squared it by missing her <span class="sc">Sherwin</span>,</p>
<p>Both with smashed fingers! Rum luck! But then cricketing luck <i>is</i> a twister.</p>
<p>And <span class="sc">Sherwin</span> turned up second innings. <i>Did</i> you twig his face when he missed her,</p>
<p>That ball from <span class="sc">J. Shuter</span>, our Captain? It ranked pretty high among matches,</p>
<p>But Surrey <i>did</i> make <i>some</i> mistakes, Sir, and Notts&mdash;&mdash;well, they <i>couldn't</i> hold catches.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Shuter</span> shone up, did he not? Forty-four, fifty-three, and <i>such</i> cutting!</p>
<p>Hooray! Here's his jolly good health, and look sharp, for they're close upon shutting.</p>
<p>Partial be blowed! I'm a Surreyite down to my socks, that's a fact, Sir.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/061-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/061-2.png" alt="" /></a><h3>Shrews&mdash;bery!</h3></div>
<p><i>Must</i> shout when my countymen score, and don't mind being caught in the act, Sir.</p>
<p>Cracks didn't somehow come off. <span class="sc">Arthur Shrewsbury</span>, Notts' great nonsuch,</p>
<p>Didn't make fifty all told, and our <span class="sc">Walter</span>&mdash;the world holds but <i>one</i> such&mdash;</p>
<p>A poor twenty-five and eighteen&mdash;a mere fleabite for W. W.</p>
<p>Still, he's our glory; and <i>if</i> you can spot such another, I'll trouble you.</p>
<p><i><span class="sc">Grace</span></i>? Why, of course, in his day he was cock of the walk&mdash;that's a moral.</p>
<p>I won't say a word against <i>him</i>; but our <span class="sc">Walter</span>!&mdash;well, there, we won't quarrel.</p>
<p>I'm Surrey, you know, as I said. I remember <span class="sc">Jupp, Humphry</span>, and <span class="sc">Stevenson</span>,</p>
<p>Burly <span class="sc">Ben Griffith</span>, and <span class="sc">Southerton</span>! Well, if it ever was evens on</p>
<p>Match, it was surely on <i>this</i> one. Oh, yes, <i>I</i> gave points, six to five, Sir,</p>
<p>But then I have always backed Surrey, and <i>will</i> do so whilst I'm alive, Sir.</p>
<p>And t'other was Notts, don't you see, so <i>I</i> couldn't well show the white feather.</p>
<p>Ah! well, 'twas a wonderful match; such a crowd, such a game, and such weather!</p>
<p>K. J. K. (that's Mr. <span class="sc">Key</span>) showed remarkably promising cricket&mdash;</p>
<p>I <i>did</i> feel a little bit quisby when <span class="sc">Sherwin</span> snapped him at the wicket.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/061-3.png"><img width="100%" src="images/061-3.png" alt="" /></a><h3>Gunn and Barnes.</h3></div>
<p>'Twas getting too close, Sir, for comfort; two hundred and five takes some making&mdash;</p>
<p>When <span class="sc">Barnes</span> nicked <span class="sc">Read, Shuter</span>, and <span class="sc">Henderson</span>, 'gad, there were lots of hearts quaking.</p>
<p>Seventy-eight for a win, Sir, and five of our best wickets levelled.</p>
<p>Notts then began to pick up, and I own I felt rather blue-devilled;</p>
<p>But Surrey has got a rare team, and you see, when the toppers do fail, Sir,</p>
<p>They look at it this way, my boy,&mdash;there is all the more chance for the "tail," Sir.</p>
<p>That's what I call true cricket pluck, and so, even when <span class="sc">Maurice Read</span> quitted him,</p>
<p>That's what young <span class="sc">Lohmann</span> perceived; the place wanted cool grit&mdash;and it fitted him.</p>
<p>His thirty-five, and not out, was worth more, Sir, than many a "Century."</p>
<p>Played like an iceberg, he did; style neither too tame nor too venture-y.</p>
<p>Poor crippled <span class="sc">Wood</span> backed him bravely, and he made the winning hit, he did.</p>
<p>Won by four wickets! Hooray! Gallant Surrey at last has succeeded</p>
<p>In knocking the dust out of Notts. I've hoorayed till my tongue feels quite furry.</p>
<p>Yes, <i>I</i> like the best side to win,&mdash;but I'm thundering glad, though, it's Surrey!!!</p>

<p>In wrath redundant <span class="sc">Swinburne</span> turns and rends</p>
<p>The "good grey" bard. Alack for <span class="sc">Swinburne's</span> "friends"!</p>

<p>The idols he once worshipped now he'd burn,</p>

<p>There'll be but one to round upon&mdash;himself.</p>

<h2>ELEGANT EXTRACTS BY EMINENT MEN.</h2>

<p>A very interesting article appears in the current
number of the <i>Fortnightly Magazine</i>, in which the
favourite "quotations" of many celebrated persons are introduced
with much effect. Always ready to take a hint,
<i>Mr. Punch</i> has asked everyone he knows to furnish him
with his predilections. The following is the result:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Briefless</span>, Junior, of Pump-handle Court writes,
"I have carefully considered the circular you have forwarded
to me, and am distinctly of opinion that my
favourite reading is, 'With you the Attorney-General.'"</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Robert</span>" says that his favourite phrase is, "'Ere's
'alf a sovereign for yourself, but you deserves more!"</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">'Arry</span>" says he can't think of anything more "fust
class" than, "The 'orn of the 'unter is 'eard on the 'ill."</p>

<p>And (more or less) the whole world declares that there
is no pleasanter announcement than "<i>Punch, or the
London Charivari</i>, is published every Wednesday."</p>

<hr />

<h2>Mem. for Our Muddlers.</h2>

<p>It <i>cannot</i> be in the interests of peace that we turn
our swords into&mdash;corkscrews, and our bayonets into&mdash;button-hooks.
That extremely secular reading of a
sacred passage, appears to be the accepted one, however,
in Ordnance Departments, and other places where
they play the fool.</p>

<h2>THE END OF THE JUBILEE.</h2>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>I've been to the Abbey, the Naval Review,</p>
<p>The Maske at Gray's Inn and the Institute too;</p>
<p>In fact I feel just like the Wandering Jew,</p>
<p class="i2">Or other historical rover:</p>
<p>I've turned day into night and the night into day,</p>
<p>In a regular rollicking Jubilee way,</p>
<p>And now I can truly and thankfully say,</p>
<p class="i2">I'm uncommonly glad that it's over.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>I've been to a number of Jubilee balls,</p>
<p>And I'm really worn out by the parties and calls;</p>
<p>I've fed in the City 'neath shade of St. Paul's,</p>
<p class="i2">And ate little fish by the river:</p>
<p>I've been to big picnics both up and down stream,</p>
<p>I've wallowed in strawberries smothered in cream,</p>
<p>Which, following lobster, most doctors would deem</p>
<p class="i2">Was remarkably bad for the liver.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>I've read all the Jubilee articles, loads</p>
<p>Of Jubilee leaders and Jubilee odes,</p>
<p>And seen how each poet his Pegasus goads,</p>
<p class="i2">Though gaining but slight inspiration;</p>
<p>A chaos of Jubilee Numbers I've seen,</p>
<p>And Jubilee pictures and lives of the <span class="sc">Queen</span>,</p>
<p>And the Jubilee coinage that's greeted, I ween,</p>
<p class="i2">With anything but jubilation.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>But, now all is over, sincerely I trust</p>
<p>The Nation no longer will kick up a dust,</p>
<p>The Jubilee really has done for me just</p>
<p class="i2">As "<i>Commodious</i>" scared <i>Mr. Boffin</i>:</p>
<p>Any more jubilation would finish me quite,</p>
<p>As it is I've a horrible dream every night</p>
<p>That a Jubilee demon is screwing me tight</p>
<p class="i2">Down into a Jubilee coffin!</p>
</div> </div>

<hr />

<p class="center">The Correct Card.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mr. Goldwin Smith</span> says:&mdash;"The one thing certain
about Tory-Democracy, besides its origin, is, that it is
the card of a political gamester." It may perhaps help
the ponderous Professor, in a future philippic, to know,
in addition, that the associations of Tory-Democracy
at once suggest "Clubs," and the game it is playing, the
"deuce."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Air</span>&mdash;"<i>Ballyhooly.</i>"</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>There's a dashing sort of bhoy who was once his country's joy,</p>
<p class="i2">But his ructions and his rows no longer charm me,</p>
<p>He often takes command in a fury-spouting band</p>
<p class="i2">Called the "Ballyhooly" Parliamentary Army.</p>
<p>At Donnybrook's famed fair he might shine with radiance rare,</p>
<p class="i2">A "Pathriot" he's called, and may be truly,</p>
<p>It is catching, I'm afraid, for when <i>he</i> is on parade</p>
<p class="i2">There seems scarce a sober man in "Ballyhooly."</p>

<p class="i2">Whililoo, hi ho! Faith they all enlist, ye know,</p>
<p class="i4">Though their ructions and their shindies fail to charm me,</p>
<p class="i2">Bad language, howls, and hate put an end to fair debate</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Spayker</span>, honest soul, finds they're quite beyond control,</p>
<p class="i2">Discussion takes a most extinded radius,</p>
<p>It's about as fine and clear as the stalest ginger-beer,</p>
<p class="i2">But the "bhoys," they never seem to find it "tadyious."</p>
<p>And what is worse, to-day all the Army march one way,</p>
<p class="i2">That is in being ructious and unruly,</p>
<p>If a Mimber in debate wants to argue fair and straight,</p>
<p class="i2">Faith they howl him out of court in "Ballyhooly."</p>
<p class="i10"><i>Chorus</i>&mdash;Whililoo, hi, ho, &amp;c.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>They're supposed to hould debate in the interests of the State,</p>
<p class="i2">Which one and all they do their best to injure;</p>
<p>I have said their talk's as clear as the stalest ginger-beer,</p>
<p class="i2">And they mix the vilest vitriol with the ginger.</p>
<p>The bhoys are not alone, for in sorrow one must own</p>
<p class="i2">The young Tories are as noisy and unruly,</p>
<p>And the Rads they rave and rail till one longs to lodge in gaol</p>
<p class="i2">The intemperate brigade of "Ballyhooly."</p>
<p class="i10"><i>Chorus</i>&mdash;Whililoo, hi, ho, &amp;c.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>There's a moral to my song, and it won't detain yez long,</p>
<p class="i2">Of Party spirit e'en the merest "nip" shun.</p>
<p>It's poison, that is clear, Ballyhooly "ginger-beer,"</p>
<p class="i2">As ye'll own when I have given the prescription.</p>
<p>You take heaps of Party "rot," spirit mean, and temper hot,</p>
<p class="i2">Lies, blasphemy, and insult; mix them duly;</p>
<p>For sugar put in salt, bitter gall for honest malt,</p>
<p class="i2">Faith, they call it "Statesmanship" in "Ballyhooly."</p>
<p class="i10"><i>Chorus</i>&mdash;Whililoo, hi, ho, &amp;c.</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p class="i16"><i>Encore Verse.</i></p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p>Since you're kind enough to crave just another little stave,</p>
<p class="i2">I'll explain the furious ferment that now leavens</p>
<p>A tipple once so sound is just Party spite all round,</p>
<p class="i2">And of course <i>my</i> Ballyhooly is St. Stephen's.</p>
<p>'Twill be very long before you will wish to cry "Encore!"</p>
<p class="i2">To the row that makes our Parliament unruly;</p>
<p>For good sense would put a stop on the flow of Party "Pop"</p>
<p class="i2">That makes a Donnybrook of "Ballyhooly."</p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p class="i18"><i>Chorus.</i></p>
</div> <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Whililoo, hi, ho! 'Tis a huge mistake, ye know,</p>
<p class="i4">To let ructions and recriminations charm ye.</p>
<p class="i2">If they don't abate their hate, they'll bring ruin on the State,</p>
<p class="i4">Will the Ballyhooly Parliamentary Army.</p>

<h2>Very Like a Wales.</h2>

<p>The zeal of the Actor who blacked himself all over to play <i>Othello</i>,
is at last outdone&mdash;by Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, who, it is stated, is learning
the Welsh language, under the tuition of Mr. <span class="sc">Richard</span>, M.P., in
order to deliver his speech at the forthcoming Eisteddfod in <span class="sc">Taffy's</span>
own tongue. "Not for <span class="sc">Cadwallader</span> and all his goats," as <i>Pistol</i>
says, would an ordinary politician go through such an ordeal for

<h2>THE TRAVELLER'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> I understand that you are leaving Town. Why?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Because it is the fashion.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Have you any plans?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I am a little undecided. At first I thought of going to an
English watering-place, but abandoned the idea because the papers
said I should be sure to be laid up with typhoid fever, German
measles, or something equally pleasant.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Had it not been for this dread, should you have gone?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I suppose so. We are acclimatised to the discomforts of seaside
lodgings, the discords of second-rate German bands, and the
disillusions of country views.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> For the sake of argument, abandoning the English watering-place&mdash;where
shall you go?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> My wife says Paris&mdash;and means it.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you object yourself to the gay capital?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Well&mdash;just now&mdash;yes; chiefly because it is not gay.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> I suppose you would prefer the principal theatres to be open?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> If I could attend them without being sure that I should find
the "hot room" of a Turkish bath considerably cooler. Not that
there would not be a risk of being grilled to death on the Boulevards
and bored out of my life by running across hundreds of personally-conducted
tourists.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then why should you go?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because my wife wishes to see the bonnets.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Could she see them nowhere else?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not to her satisfaction, although I believe she could find their
counterparts in Tottenham Court Road and the Westbourne Grove.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> After Paris where shall you go?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Either to Switzerland, Italy, or Holland.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you expect much amusement?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not much, because I know them by heart. Still I know the
best hotels, or rather the best <i>table d'h&ocirc;tes</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is that all you care for?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Nearly all. However it is a languid satisfaction to compare
St. Peter's with St. Paul's to the disadvantage of the former, and to
think there is nothing in Switzerland to equal the Trossachs, Loch
Maree and the Cumberland Lakes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But the Art treasures?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> May be found <i>en bloc</i> at the South Kensington Museum.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then you travel in rather a gloomy mood.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Rather. Still I am buoyed up with a delightful prospect in
the future.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> A delightful prospect! What prospect?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The prospect of returning home!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/065.png"><img width="100%" src="images/065.png" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>Some little while since a book was published for the exclusive
benefit of the fair sex, which purported to teach men's mothers,
sisters, cousins, and aunts, the advantages
bestowed upon them by the
Married Women's Property Act, and
other statutes of a like character. No
doubt the volume was an excellent
guide to females fond of litigation;
but still there are many who prefer,
in spite of everything, to retain their
own fixed opinion on the subject of law.
For that feminine majority the following
congenial hints are published:&mdash;</p>

<p>If a woman makes a will, she can
never revoke it, and is likely to die
soon afterwards, as it is not only unnecessary,
but unlucky.</p>

<p>A marriage without bridesmaids is
nearly illegal. This applies, in a lesser
degree, to marriages where children,
dressed in Charles the First costumes,
are not employed to hold up the bride's
train.</p>

<p>A mortgage is a sort of thing that causes a house to become the
possession of a dishonest Agent, who is usually a Solicitor.</p>

<p>The best way of settling a County Court summons, brought in the
absence of the master of the house, is to ask the man into the
dining-room, and tell him about the accomplishments of the children.
This will soften his heart, and get him to prevent the Judge
from sending everyone to prison.</p>

<p>A nice Solicitor never contradicts a Lady, and therefore knows the
law infinitely better than the disagreeable fogies, who are so
obstinate. And, lastly, the best way to learn the real provisions of
the law, is to study a modern novel by a lady Authoress.</p>

<hr />

<h2>SALUBRITIES ABROAD.</h2>

<p>"<i>Salubrities at Home</i>" (<i>pace</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Atlas</span>, who will recognise this
temporary adaptation of his world-renowned title) I should say are
Buxton (for most people), Bath (for some), Harrogate (for others),
and,&mdash;besides a variety of North, South, East and West, too numerous
to be mentioned in these notes,&mdash;Ramsgate for nearly all.</p>

<p>"<i>Salubrities Abroad</i>" are Homburg, Aix-les-Bains, Carlsbad,
&amp;c., &amp;c., and Royat, where I find myself again this year. "Scenes
of my bath-hood, once more I behold ye!" There is "A Salubrity at
Royat," which people of certain tendencies cannot easily find elsewhere.
It is a cure for eminent persons of strong Conservative
tendencies. Lord <span class="sc">Salisbury</span> was here last year, and my friend
Monsieur <span class="sc">Ondit</span>, who is in everybody's confidence, tells me that his
Lordship will revisit a place where the <i>traitement</i> did him so much
good. I believe he underwent the "Cherry-cure," at all events his
Lordship was seen in public constantly eating them out of a paper-bag.
<i>What did he do with the bag?</i> My answer is, "he popped it."
Down went the cherries, and bang went the bag and fifty centimes.
Well, did not Royat effect some change in his conservatism? What
has been the result? But I am not here to talk politics.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Everybody is talking of the <span class="sc">Boulanger-Ferry</span> incident. This is
Aug. 4, and nothing has happened.</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"Il n'y a pas de danger,"</p>
<p class="i2">Dit G&eacute;n&eacute;ral <span class="sc">Boulanger</span>;</p>
<p>"Tout va, je crois, s'arranger,</p>
<p class="i4">Chez <span class="sc">Ferry</span>, mes amis."</p>
</div></div>

<p>I haven't time to proceed with this, but, so far, the idea is at any
poet's disposition to continue as he pleases, my only stipulation being
that the air to which it is to be sung shall be "<i>Marlbrook</i>."</p>

<p>My other friend, <span class="sc">Benjamin Trovato</span>, of Italian extraction, tells
me that <span class="sc">Boulanger</span> is half English, and had an English education.
<span class="sc">Ben</span> informs me that the General has never forgotten the rhythms
he learnt in his happy English nursery; and that, when he read
that <span class="sc">M. Ferry</span> had called him a "<i>St. Arnaud de Caf&eacute;-Concert</i>,"
he sang out, recollecting the old catch,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>A Note, a Note!</p>
<p>Haste to the Ferry!</p>
</div></div>

<p>in which his friends were unable to join, owing to their ignorance of
the words and tune.</p>

<p>When driving through Clermont-Ferrand from the Station up to
Royat, we (three of us) had a small omnibus to ourselves. One of
the party (a wag, of whom, and of the circumstances of our meeting,
more "in my next") insisted on our calling out, "<i>Vive</i> <span class="sc">Boulanger</span>!"
We did this several times in the most crowded parts, but the cry
obtained no response, and aroused no excitement, as, being uttered
with the greatest caution (at my instance), nobody heard it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>But what a thing to fight about! If duelling were an English
fashion, how fruitful of "incidents" this Session would have been.
How often would Mr. <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> have been "out"? And Mr.
<span class="sc">De Lisle's</span> life would have hung upon a Lisle thread!</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Note for strangers about to visit Royat.&mdash;The Continental Hotel
has lost a little territory, as half of what was its terrace has been
returned to the present proprietor of the hotel next door, with whom
we Continentals have no connection, not even "on business," it not
being "the same concern" and under one management as it was
last year. But what the Continental Hotel has sacrificed in domain,
Monsieur <span class="sc">Hall</span>, our obliging landlord, has more than made up in
comfort and cooking. Dr. <span class="sc">Brandt</span> sees his patients in a charming
Villa of Flowers. The weather is lovely.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We are all surprised at seeing one another here. Each person (or
each couple or party) seems to think that he alone (or they alone)
possess the secret of Royat's existence. We certainly are not a
mutual admiration society at Royat. When we come upon one
another suddenly, each exclaims, "Hallo! what are <i>you</i> here for?"
is if the other were a convict "doing his time." Everyone thinks
he knows what he is here for, but very few tell what he thinks he
knows. And, by the way, the best-informed among us doesn't know
very much about it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In the Reading-room of the <i>Cercle</i> there ought to be (as advertised
in a local journal) at least three English newspapers daily. I
have not seen them as yet. The only London paper arriving here
regularly, and to be purchased every day early at the Newsvendor's,
is the <i>Morning Post</i>. <i>Vive</i> Sir <span class="sc">Algernon</span>! Can this be the attraction
for Lord <span class="sc">Salisbury</span>? Why come out so far afield to read the
<i>Morning Post</i>? Or wasn't it here, during Lord <span class="sc">Salisbury's</span> visit
last year, and is he still ignorant of its having been subsequently
demanded and supplied this season? And when he comes and finds it&mdash;"O
what a surprise!"&mdash;no, thank goodness, we have escaped
from this song&mdash;for a time, at least.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Too hot to write any more journal. The hundredth bell is sounding
for the fiftieth <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>. My <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> is finished. There are bells
here perpetually. All day and all night. In vain would Mr. <span class="sc">Irving</span>
as <i>Mathias</i>, put his hands to his ears and close the windows. The
bells! The bells! Distant bells, near bells, sheep-bells, goat-bells,
a man with pipe (not tobacco but tune, or what he and the goats
consider a tune), dinner-bells, guests'-bells, servants'-bells, church-bells
(not much), chapel-bells (early and occasionally), horse-bells,
donkey-bells, breakfast-bells, supper-bells, arrival-bells, departure-bells,
tramway bells, crier's-bells, with variations on drum or trumpet,
and several other bells that I shall notice in the course of the twenty-four
hours, but have forgotten just now.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The "<i>petits chevaux</i>" have not been stopped by the Government;
they are running as fast as ever. There are two bands, playing
morning, afternoon, and evening. The <i>Casino Samie</i> is as lively as
ever, or, as my waggish acquaintance at once expressed it, in that
vein of humour for which he is so specially distinguished, "The
Samie old game," and to sit out in the garden, with a fragrant cigar
and coffee, before retiring for the night, is indeed a calm pleasure, or
would be but for the aforesaid waggishness, of which more anon.</p>

<p>Soldiers about everywhere, Boulangering. Up in the hills is a
splendid echo. This morning, having caught the very slightest cold,
I went up into the mountains to get it blown away. Suddenly I
sneezed. Such a sneeze! It reverberated all over the mountain like
the firing of a battery. Again! again! These sneezes nearly shook
me off the rock, and sent me staggering on to the <i>plateau</i> below.
The effect must have been alarming, as the third sneeze fetched
out the military, horse and foot, at full gallop, and the double.
<i>L'ennemi? C'&eacute;tait moi!</i> They scoured the mountain sides, but I
did not sneeze again. I have a sort of idea that my sneeze upset the
entire preconcerted arrangements for a review. The Boulangerers
retired&mdash;so did I.</p>

<h2>OUR EXCHANGE AND MART.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Some more Holiday Inquiries.</span></p>

<p>NOVEL YACHTING EXPEDITION. UNIQUE CHANCE.&mdash;A
Gentleman of marked nautical proclivities, who has lately,
through the demise of a great-uncle, come into the possession of a
Penny Steamer in a very fair condition of repair, is anxious to meet
with one or two persons of similar tastes who would be disposed to
start with him on a Summer Tour, for the purpose of leisurely navigating
the vessel, in a tentative fashion, round the British Isles.
As he would not take a Pilot with him, but proposes when in doubt
either to ask his way from the nearest Coastguard by signal, or run
in shore and get out and walk, he thinks the voyage would not be
without excitement and variety, and would be likely to afford some
novel seafaring experience to the naval amateur in search of pleasing
adventure. The course, as at present mapped out, would be from
Putney Bridge to Margate, Plymouth, Holyhead, Skye, Aberdeen,
by the German Ocean past Hull, Yarmouth, Clacton-on-Sea, Southend,
back again, finishing the journey at Battersea Reach, but it
would probably be varied by wind and weather, the exigences of
which would naturally have to be taken into account. The crew
will consist of three experienced Channel stewards, a bargee, a
retired pirate, and a cabin-boy, and will be under the command of
the advertiser, who, though fresh to the work, has little doubt but
that, with a friendly hint or two from his fellow-yachtsmen, he will
be able to manage it. N.B.&mdash;Each Passenger provided with a Royal
Humane Society's drag. For all further particulars apply to "<span class="sc">Port-Admiral</span>,"
117, Rope Walk, Chelsea, S.W.</p>

<hr />

<p>EXCEPTIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL OPPORTUNITY.
HAUNTED CASTLE TO LET.&mdash;A Baronet, in the North
of England, who can himself stand residence in it no longer, is
anxious to meet with a suitable Tenant for his Family Mansion
likely to appreciate the mysterious horrors with which, owing to the
crimes of his ancestors in times past, it is now nightly associated.
The chief manifestation consists in the appearance, after midnight,
in an oak-panelled bedroom, of a huge black wolf, accompanied by a
little old man in a bag-wig and faded blue velvet coat, who, looking
sadly at the occupant, and saying, in a mournful voice, "I've lost
my return-ticket!" vanishes suddenly, together with his swarthy
companion, into the linen-cupboard. As this apparition is frequently
followed by the sound as of a man in a complete suit of armour
falling head-over-heels down six flights of
stairs, and ultimately, amidst prolonged and
piercing shrieks, apparently lodging in the
coal-cellar, a member of the Society for
Promoting Psychical Research could not fail
to find the whole experience a singularly
pleasing one. Several people having already
been frightened into fits through passing a
night in the castle, a practical joker, who
wished to have a little fun at the expense
of an aged and invalid relative or two, could
not do better than ask them down for a
week, and let them take turns at sleeping
in the bedroom in question. Address,
"<span class="sc">Baronet</span>," Goblynhurst, Howlover.</p>

<hr />

<p>TIGER-SHOOTING AT HOME. PRIME SPORT WITH BIG
GAME.&mdash;A Country Clergyman, who, having taken charge
of a Menagerie for an invalid friend, has had the misfortune
to let nearly the whole of it escape and get loose in his parish, would
be glad to have the assistance of several Sportsmen of wide Indian
and African experience, who would be willing to join him in an
effort either to kill, or, if possible, recapture it at the very earliest
opportunity. Though the Advertiser has succeeded in temporarily
securing three lions, a chimpanzee, a couple of hy&aelig;nas, and a young
hippopotamus in the Vicarage drawing-room, and has managed to
envelope a boa-constrictor in a lawn-tennis net, yet, as five full-grown
Bengal tigers, and about thirty other wild beasts of a miscellaneous
character are at large in the village, and have, to his
knowledge, already devoured the Postman, the Curate, a School
Inspector, and both the horses of the Local Railway Omnibus, he
feels that no time ought to be lost in replying to his appeal. One or
two Experts, armed with Hotchkiss Guns, would be of use, and might
write. Would be glad to hear from a Battery of Horse Artillery.
Address, The <span class="sc">Vicar</span>, High Roaring, Notts.</p>

<p>AERIAL VOYAGE. ADVANTAGEOUS EXPERIMENT FOR
THE SHORT-SIGHTED.&mdash;A Gentleman who has long been
suffering from a chronic affection of the eyes, and has been recommended
by his medical adviser to try the stimulating effect of
mountain air, having conceived the idea of procuring it for himself
by making an ascent in a second-hand and slightly damaged balloon
that he has purchased for the purpose, will be glad to hear from one
or two thoroughly skilled and experienced A&euml;ronauts similarly afflicted,
who would regard the beneficent results of being able to accompany
him as an equivalent for the professional services they might render
to the carrying out of the undertaking. As the Advertiser's idea is
to start from some convenient Gas-Works in the Midland Counties,
and keep a steady northward course by holding on, before the wind,
with a line and grappling-hook to the system of telegraphic wires
running alongside one of the great central railways, and as he
proposes merely stopping occasionally <i>en route</i> to unroof the house of
some local medical man when any of the party are in need of advice,
he confidently anticipates that the trip will not be devoid of novel
and exciting features that will invest it with a distinctively fresh
and exhilarating character. For full and further particulars of the
enterprise, which have been carefully thought out, apply, by letter,
to "<span class="sc">In Nubibus</span>," Uppingham Lodge, Mount-Rising, Ayrshire.</p>

<p>THREE THOUSAND BLAZING ACRES TO LET.&mdash;A Scotch
Laird, who has, by some accident in celebrating Her
Majesty's Jubilee, managed to set fire to his entire property, the
whole of which, after smouldering for a season, has since burst into
a violent conflagration, which he can neither diminish nor control,
would be willing to let it at a comparatively low rental to a London
Sportsman sufficient novice in grouse-shooting not to be surprised
at picking up his birds already roasted in the heather. As at the
end of a day's trudging in the blinding heat of a Sahara through
smoking covers, accompanied by a powerful steam fire-engine, he
will probably discover that he has only succeeded in making a bag
consisting of one singed "cheeper," the "shooting" is likely to
prove more attractive to the amateur unfamiliar with the rifle, but
accustomed to the tropical heat of a Central African Summer, than
satisfactory to a professional marksman counting on dispatching
from a breezy moorland fifty brace or so to his relatives and friends.&mdash;For

<h2>FOREIGN (LANGUAGE) COMPETITION.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Care Editor</span>,&mdash;<span class="sc">Sentio</span> obligatus scribere ad te propter extraordinariam novam departuram
quam Gubernator recenter fecit. (Scribo Latin&egrave;, quia si ille legit hoc, <i>non poterit intelligere</i>!
Pr&aelig;tendit intelligere Classica perfect&egrave;, sed habeo graves dubitationes de illo. Hoc est inter nos.)</p>

<p>Sunt nostri holidies nunc, ut tu sine dubio es awarus; et, alio mane, Pater subito nunciavit
suam intentionem detrahere me de Etonis, et mittere me ad aliquem Tutorem in Germani&acirc;, "in
ordinem ut discam modernas linguas, sic importantes (ille ait) in cursu vit&aelig; nunc-dies."</p>

<p>Fui attonitus, ut tu potes imaginare. Nam Gubernator, ut totus mundus noscit, semper fuit
laudator Classicorum. ("Omne ignotum pro magnifico," intelligis; habeo illum illic, nonne? Hoc
quoque est inter nos.) In facto, pro momento ego fui "percussus omnis cumuli," ut dictum est.

Habere linquere Etonas, tam jolliam scholam! Et ire ad istos Teutones, qui non possunt ludere
vel cricketum vel footballum, et sunt generaliter horribiles muffi! Id est nimis malum pro verbis.</p>

<p>Vide explanationem patern&aelig; inconsistenti&aelig;! Forsitan vidisti, <span class="sc">O Punche</span>, quomodo aliqui
journales pestilentes recenter abusi sunt Classicas linguas. Bene, Gubernator legit hos journales,
et nunc odit Gr&aelig;cum et Latinum. Ego ipse odi Gr&aelig;cum, sed Germanum est multo pejus, si possibile.
Ut pro Gallico, non est ita difficile, except&acirc; pronunciatione, qu&aelig; est bestiissima res umquam inventa.
Sed "malo mispronunciare ad Etonas, quam in Continenti rect&egrave; dicere," ut <span class="sc">Cicero</span> dicit.</p>

<p>Protestavi contra novam ideam Gubernatoris tantum quam audeo; sed habeo esse cautus, quia
Gubernator non amat contradictionem. Fit cereus, si contradicitur. Argui tamen ut obliviscar
omnia mea Classica in Germani&acirc; celerius quam potes dicere "Johannes Robinson;" nam unum
caput non potest tenere Gr&aelig;cum, Latinum, Germanum, <i>et</i> Gallicum. Gubernator iracund&egrave;
respondit ut "<i>meum</i> caput non potest tenere aliquam rem, ut videtur." Hoc est abominabilis
libellus (inter nos iterum).</p>

<p>Tunc posui ante eum pericula
duellorum. Juvenes Teutonici omnes
ineunt pro duellis, ut habeo auditum.
Pater (crudelis!) fecit extrem&egrave; leve
hujus periculi. "Si redeam sine
naso, quid tum?" dixi. "Erit propria
p&oelig;na," Gubernator sarcastic&egrave;
respondit, "pro negligente <span class="sc">Nasonem</span>
ad scholam." Ille, percipis, "ridet
ad cicatrices, quia nunquam sensit
vulnus." Laudat Caput-Magistros
Marlburienses et Harrovienses et
Winchesterenses pro expellendo
Gr&aelig;cum de Intranti Examinatione
pro illis scholis. Sperat ut "in nullo
tempore ero bonus Germanus scholaris";
sed ego dubito. Dixi ad
eum ut sola Germana verba que nosco
sunt "Die Wacht am Rhein." Gubernator
respondit ut meus Tutor
donaret mihi "die whacks am Rhein"
si negligo curriculum studiorum.
Jocus est extrem&egrave; pauper. Admiror
si Tutor ver&egrave; donabit id mihi calidum?
O care Editor, nonne potes
facere aliquam rem pro retinente me
ad Etonas? Tuus disconsolatus,</p>

<p><i>Monday Night, August 1.</i>&mdash;Prince Louis of <span class="sc">Battenberg</span> had better be making inquiries
as to return trains for Germany. <span class="sc">W. Redmond</span> "has had his attention called to him," and
<span class="sc">Pickersgill</span> has his eye upon him. German Prince been appointed to command of <i>Dreadnought</i>
over thirty British Officers who had precedence for promotion. <span class="sc">W. Redmond</span> elicited
more general cheering than usually falls to his lot when he wanted to know what reason could
be given for so extraordinary a mark of confidence? <span class="sc">Georgy Hamilton</span> explained that there
was best possible reason. Prince <span class="sc">Louis</span> a heaven-born sea-Captain. No one like him among
ordinary Britishers. Appointed to <i>Dreadnought</i> simply because he was best possible man.
Then <span class="sc">Pickersgill</span> came to front. Couldn't object to First Lord's personal preference, but
gave notice that if Prince <span class="sc">Louis</span> were confirmed in command of <i>Dreadnought</i> he would move
that his salary be disallowed. More cheers. Idea of German Princeling holding office, however
honourable, without drawing a salary struck Commons as comical. Subject seemed to
drop here. But <span class="sc">Commerell</span>, having by this time had another question on other subject put
and answered, collected his thoughts, rose and begged to say that "Prince Louis of <span class="sc">Battenberg</span>
served under me, and a more efficient officer&mdash;&mdash;" Here sentence came to abrupt
conclusion. Angry cries of "Order!" stormed round gallant Admiral. <span class="sc">Commerell</span> a man of
proved valour, as the Victoria Cross worn on his breast on Jubilee Day and other high festivities
testifies. But his bronzed cheek blanched under this assault. He stared round a
moment speechless, and resumed his seat.</p>

<p>House in Committee through long hours on Irish Land Bill. Dulness enlivened towards
midnight by encounter between <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> and <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>. <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> began it;
<span class="sc">Grandolph</span> by no means backward. Rebuked <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> for "characteristic sneer,"
upon which <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> smartly retorted. The interesting episode concluded by <span class="sc">Hartington</span>
announcing his intention to vote against <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> and with the Government.
<span class="sc">Harcourt</span> much pleased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>"This is only the beginning," he said. "<span class="sc">Grandolph</span> and <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>
have evidently quarrelled. <span class="sc">Hartington</span> doesn't bind himself
to go with <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>; and altogether the Unionist Party
seems a little disunited."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Irish Land Bill in Committee.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Questions over there was a pretty scene. <span class="sc">John Dillon</span>
complained of allegation in provincial newspaper that he had applauded
a statement that in a riot at Belfast several children and a
young lady school-teacher, the daughter of Lord <span class="sc">Sligo's</span> Agent, were
seriously hurt. Hadn't proceeded far with explanation when voice
from neighbourhood of Treasury Bench called out, "It is true!"</p>

<p>"Who says it's true?" shouted <span class="sc">John</span>, flashing a baleful glance
on Treasury Bench.</p>

<p>At first he thought the interrupter was Old Morality, but his air
of perfect innocence repulsed suspicion. Was it <span class="sc">De Worms</span>, turning
as, it is written, his family sometimes do? <span class="sc">Edward Clarke</span> looked
more guilty, so <span class="sc">John</span> "named" him; denied the soft impeachment.
<span class="sc">Halsey</span> admitted it, and was backed up by half-a-dozen Members,
including <span class="sc">Maclean</span>. Bore personal testimony to having heard the
applause when incident was mentioned.</p>

<p>"I say it is true!" they repeated one after the other.</p>

<p>"And I say it is false!" <span class="sc">John Dillon</span> roared, and proceeded to
denounce Members opposite in language which speedily brought up
the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>.</p>

<p>After a while <span class="sc">Maclean</span> again interposed. Demanded to be heard
whilst he asserted in detail the general accuracy of the newspaper
paragraph, whilst of course acquitting <span class="sc">Dillon</span> "if he said he did
not join in applause." Parnellites, oddly enough, left all the fighting
to <span class="sc">John</span>, who was finally put down by <span class="sc">Speaker</span>. After this pleasant
interlude, House resumed Committee on Land Bill. Proceedings

end by a Count.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Enter <span class="sc">Trevelyan</span>; exit <span class="sc">Edward
Russell</span>, the latter carrying with him the consciousness
of that rare possession&mdash;popularity with
both sides of the House. Everybody sorry he has
gone, especially "the Dissentient Liberals." As
<span class="sc">Plunket</span> says, "He was the gentlest-mannered
Radical in the House." Crowded House. <span class="sc">Trevelyan</span>
brings his sheaves (1401) with him, in shape
of rattling majority won at Glasgow. Everybody
there but <span class="sc">Hartington</span> and <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>. Meeting
in such circumstances with old colleague would have
been too touching. But older colleagues, under
wing of <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>, in full force. Determined to
kill the fatted calf for the returning prodigal.
<span class="sc">Gladstone</span> would, of course, play the part of
Aged Parent; <span class="sc">Trevelyan</span> the repentant son. But who was to stand
for the fatted calf? General impression that <span class="sc">Harcourt</span> best suited by
natural gifts for the character. <span class="sc">Harcourt's</span> habitual modesty not to
be overcome. "Wouldn't," he said, "like to play such a prominent
part." Finally agreed that they should "imagine the calf." All went
admirably well. Might have been managed by that veteran strategist
the Sage of Queen Anne's Gate.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Childers</span> and <span class="sc">Cameron</span> (both out of step with new Member)
personally conducted him to Table. Enormous cheering, which
<span class="sc">Childers</span> gently deprecated. "No, my good friends," he said. "This
is very kind of you. But there's really no credit due to me. I
bring our young friend up because I, too, am a Scotch Member.
Perhaps my success at Edinburgh may have given fillip to Liberalism
in the Lowlands. But pray don't mention it. Any little services
I may have rendered are overpaid by this magnificent ovation."</p>

<p>More cheers when new Member was introduced to <span class="sc">Speaker</span>.
Delighted to see him. Had often heard his name. Pleased with
this opportunity of making his personal acquaintance. Should be
sure to know him again if he met him. All this lively and entertaining.
But great scene artistically conceived for end of play.
<span class="sc">Trevelyan</span>, passing round back of <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> chair, proceeding in
search of quiet seat, beheld strange spectacle on Front Opposition
Bench. There was the Aged P. signalling from his tent. Signal
taken up by retainers and carried down crowded bench. Only in
the place of honour must the new Member sit. Never made so much
fuss of before. Last time took oath and seat, no particular notice
taken of double event. What had happened in meantime? Had he
grown more eloquent; had he performed some conspicuous service;
or had he increased in personal esteem of those who know him?
The latter impossible. In the former no change. He had merely
kicked over traces and was now come back to run in them. Thought
of this with some bitterness. But reception well meant. There was
the Aged P. violently beckoning with venerable forefinger, and the
errant son made his way up to him, fell on his neck and kissed him&mdash;&mdash;this
of course in a Parliamentary sense.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Army Estimates.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;House of Lords rent to its centre by deadly, blood-curdling,
butter-melting controversy. Question is, shall it be
Butterine or Margarine? The usually hostile camps streaked with
enemies. A Noble Lord, who stands stoutly for Butterine, finds
himself seated with another Peer, who swears by Margarine, and
<i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. When division comes there is woful cross-voting. It
is <span class="sc">Basing</span> who appropriately brings on subject, and <span class="sc">Wemyss</span> who
moves that the compound be called Butterine, instead of Margarine.
Everyone in high spirits, sustained by a free collation, served out at
the door. This attraction rather militated against full success of
debate. Noble Lords "asking for more," of course having to linger
outside till they'd eaten it. <span class="sc">Basing</span> (long known to us as <span class="sc">Sclater-Booth</span>)
revelled in his subject, and thanked the Markiss he was
made a Peer in time to take part in discussion. <span class="sc">Argyll</span> brought
his massive mind to bear on Butterine; <span class="sc">Granville</span> toyed with the
subject; and <span class="sc">Wemyss</span> was more than usually emphatic. <span class="sc">Bramwell</span>
had promised to speak for Butterine. Place empty when turn came.</p>

<p>"Where's <span class="sc">Bramwell</span>? He should be up next," said <span class="sc">Wemyss</span>.</p>

<p>"Ah," said <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>,</p>

<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
<p>"Would you know where last I saw him,</p>
<p>He was eating bread and butterine."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Messengers despatched to corridor and <span class="sc">Bramwell</span> brought in with
his mouth full. A stirring debate, but Butterine was nowhere.
<span class="sc">Bramwell</span> having demonstrated Margarine was "not the correct
name for the substitute known as Butterine," their Lordships by
large majority voted for Margarine.</p>
